# Java Practice Vault ☕️

Welcome to my **Java Practice Vault** — a collection of Java programs, assignments, and project snippets that I've worked on while learning through Coursera, virtual internships, and other hands-on experiences.

## 🧠 Why This Repository?

This repo serves as:

- A personal reference for Java work
- A record of my progress in learning Java through real exercises
- A showcase of my hands-on practice with Java

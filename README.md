# Learning Lab ðŸ§ª

Welcome to my **Learning Lab** â€” a collection of coding exercises, mini-projects, and assignments that Iâ€™ve completed during my journey through Coursera courses, virtual internships, and other online learning platforms.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

- Track progress across different learning platforms
- Consolidate all my practice code in one place
- Reflect on the concepts I've learned
- Showcase consistent learning and growth
